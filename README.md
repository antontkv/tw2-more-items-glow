# The Witcher 2: More Items Glow

With this mod more containers will glow like quest container, if any item in there has those tags:

- SortTypeBook (Only unread books)
- SortTypeRecipe
- SortTypeSchematic
- SortTypeTrophy
- TypeRare
- TypeEpic
- SortTypeArmorUpgrade
- SortTypeWeaponUpgrade
- SortTypeSkillUpgrade
- QuickSlot
- SortTypePotion

## Installation

Copy CookedPC into the Witcher 2 install directory, overwriting existing files.

Since `base_scripts.dzip` is modified you need to merge script files if you use other mods that change this dzip. Use [Gibbed RED Tools With UI](https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher2/mods/1027) to unpack/pack `base_scripts.dzip` and programs like WinMerge to merge files. To see what was changed in which files visit [GitHub repo](https://github.com/antontkv/tw2-more-items-glow).
